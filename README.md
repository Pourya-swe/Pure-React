# Pure form of React without any build tools, JSX, and etc.

## Q1: How did I come up with this project?

I basically followed along a course online to be able to create this project with the help of the instructor of that course.

## Q2: What did I learn and practice here in this project?

To indicate to some of it I would say that I **learned** and **practice**:

- Setting up a **Pure React** project without any modern tooling and writing React code in regular HTML file.
  - Setting a HTML boilerplate first.
  - Adding React Library as script.
  - Addind a `<div>` element with `id` of **root** because this is a standard name and way of starting **React** project.
  - Creating component function to be able to render some HTML dynamically and add some interactivity using core features of **React**.
- Creating a HTML element using **React core features**
- Creating **root** using **ReactDOM** libarary as root of our **Application** so all other component can be render in there dynamically on-demand in the Front-End
- Using some other **React core features** to add dynamic&interactive effect to the App - state & effect -.

## Q3: Why did I even learn these things?

Well, I always fond of computer science and programming, and to be honest, I want to excel in this realm
especially in front-end and back-end development, so I have started my journey from here.

## Q4: How to connect with me for any inquires related to these stuff?

**Note**: Please note that I have not been able to bring everything that I learned and practiced in detail here in this document because I think that it stretches out of this context and your tolerance, but you are free and welcome to take look at the project yourself. Also I wrote some comments in the project itself that explains and indicate to some important things that I learned and practiced along the way.
